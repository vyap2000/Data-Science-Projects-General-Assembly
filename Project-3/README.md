## Project 3

### Title:  Regression and Classification with the Ames Housing Data

### Business Case: 

#### You have just joined a new "full stack" real estate company in Ames, Iowa. The strategy of the firm is two-fold:

#### Own the entire process from the purchase of the land all the way to sale of the house, and anything in between.
#### Use statistical analysis to optimize investment and maximize return.
#### The company is still small, and though investment is substantial the short-term goals of the company are more oriented towards purchasing existing houses and flipping them as opposed to constructing entirely new houses. That being said, the company has access to a large construction workforce operating at rock-bottom prices.

#### This project uses the Ames housing data recently made available on kaggle.
