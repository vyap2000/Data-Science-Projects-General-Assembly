LTD.,,Middle Management,Information Technology,8500,12000,Monthly,11 Jan 2019,0,0,0,0,"Introducing Tookitaki Tookitaki is providing machine learning-powered enterprise solutions to address regulatory compliance problems in the financial services sector. Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-years’ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the company’s accolades include:   We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and- grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd)   We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media- Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at- inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx)   We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/)   We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product – Reconciliation Management Suite – in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager- demo-day/) In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products – Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) – cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs. Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry. Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss. Tookitaki bridges the gap with its innovative software products – AMS, RMS and PMS.            Email: careers@tookitaki.com  /  Location: Singapore .  Our Ideal Candidate The Solution Architect leads pre-sales and consultative engagements with our enterprise clients in the financial services sector, partnering with key stakeholders to create compelling visions while advising and executing on strategies.
