Particular emphasis is on building 21st century risk assessment strategies which both minimise the use of animals and increase human relevance and accuracy of risk predictions. One important area being investigated to meet this goal is the refinement of exposure-based waiving and decision making tools. By improving our understanding and accuracy of chemical exposure across the Singapore population, we can better establish the risk posed to individuals from different chemical exposures. Although the field of exposure science is not new, the establishment of relevant intake and exposure models for the S.E. Asian population are lacking, as are appropriate sources of input data for such models (e.g. branded food and consumer product databases, consumption data, and habits and practices data). Furthermore, where current efforts do exist, they tend to be targeted towards nutritional data and do not necessarily capture all aspects required for food, product and environmental safety assessments. As such, the IFCS Programme seeks a Post-Doctoral Fellow to help coordinate activities across Singapore’s government agencies (research, regulatory and health promotion) in the field of exposure assessment as well as establish their own research interests in the field. Initial funding is secured to start work on the development of a Singapore branded food products database for targeted exposure studies. Linked research interests can be broad and the particular candidate’s skills will in part influence the direction of the programme.

Particular emphasis is on building 21st century risk assessment strategies which both minimise the use of animals and increase human relevance and accuracy of risk predictions. One important area being investigated to meet this goal is the refinement of exposure-based waiving and decision making tools. By improving our understanding and accuracy of chemical exposure across the Singapore population, we can better establish the risk posed to individuals from different chemical exposures. Although the field of exposure science is not new, the establishment of relevant intake and exposure models for the S.E. Asian population are lacking, as are appropriate sources of input data for such models (e.g. branded food and consumer product databases, consumption data, and habits and practices data). Furthermore, where current efforts do exist, they tend to be targeted towards nutritional data and do not necessarily capture all aspects required for food, product and environmental safety assessments. As such, the IFCS Programme seeks a Post-Doctoral Fellow to help coordinate activities across Singapore’s government agencies (research, regulatory and health promotion) in the field of exposure assessment as well as establish their own research interests in the field. Initial funding is secured to start work on the development of a Singapore branded food products database for targeted exposure studies. Linked research interests can be broad and the particular candidate’s skills will in part influence the direction of the programme. Current interest of the programme include the development of new data collection tools and/or models relevant to food and consumer product exposure, aggregate exposure models for dual and multi-use materials, dietary intake and consumer habits and practices surveys, and biomonitoring to aid exposure.","  Motivated Postdoctoral/Early career level scientist with direct experience in the development of branded food (and/or consumer product) and compositional databases   Minimum 1 year of relevant experience   Strong leadership skills and experience supporting collaborative scientific programmes is a must, as is the ability to look strategically at future research needs in exposure science & identify the fundamental tools and knowledge gaps required to be filled to get there    A willing attitude to “start from the beginning” to build fit for purpose tools and systems suited to the diversity of the SE region and Singapore, in line with harmonized principles for exposure assessment is critical to success     The above eligibility criteria are not exhaustive. A*STAR may include additional selection criteria based on its prevailing recruitment policies. These policies may be amended from time to time without notice.
